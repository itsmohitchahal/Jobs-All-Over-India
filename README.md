# Jobs-All-Over-India
A Data Analytics and Visualisation project, aiming to find job hotspots all over India as per field. For example, it's common knowledge that Bangalore is the silicon valley of India, and thus has the greatest number of job opportunities in IT. Similarly, this project aims to plot hotspots for many more fields.

You can have a look at the jupyter notebooks that I keep uploading to this (right now they're random) to have a look at my findings so far.
Currently I am collecting more data. Once I believe I have sufficient data in all the fields of interest, I would begin precise findings and will keep updating them here in the README description
